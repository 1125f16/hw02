The code was done as a result of a lesson in a book called "Design D3.js charts by example" . 

1. Data: 

Data Choice: My initial data choices were China and Qatar but the data comparison between both countries was not very impressive.

Data Source: The data source is a CSV file downloaded from the World Bank. I uploaded the file online to increase accessibility of the data.

2. Code:

Animation: Both charts were animated, In fact, I used the same code for both data points.

D3.js Chart Library: I used d3 library because it's bubble charts filtering in Google Charts cannot filter data elements based on year. 

Thanks for your efforts!
